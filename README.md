# RNN-LSTM-GRU-and-Explainability-Using-Hugging-Face
This project compares RNN, LSTM, and GRU models on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis. However, Hugging Face explainability was attempted, but RAM limitations were faced.

**Results:** 
RNN: 52.30%
LSTM: 54.60%
GRU: 67.30% (Best performer)

**Challenges & Solutions:**
RAM constraints prevented Hugging Face integration → Used validation accuracy/loss for comparison.
GPU limitations caused crashes → Future improvements include using higher-memory instances.
